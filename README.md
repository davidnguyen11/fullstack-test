This project is a lightweight fullstack web app that allows a user to send a message and receive a response from an AI system. It simulates a real-time chat experience, where the AI replies to each message sent. The AI responses can be mocked or connected to a real LLM service (e.g. OpenAI API) depending on the implementation level.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
